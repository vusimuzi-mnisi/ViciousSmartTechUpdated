                <p>Keep your home clean from dirt and dust with the Xiaomi Robot Vacuum Cleaner S10. 
                    It features 4 adjustable suction levels for easy cleaning of dust and debris and 
                    removal of minute dust particles. It comes with a large 3200mAh battery to allow 
                    up to 130 minutes of battery life in standard mode when vacuuming and mopping. 
                    The Xiaomi S10 is also equipped with high-quality parts, including a side brush, 
                    main brush and dust box filter, with multi-directional coordination for a complete
                    and efficient cleaning experience. It uses an LDS laser navigation system to 
                    allow smart house planning and fast and precise mapping.<br><br>

                    Its smart water tank features 3 water flow levels, allowing the unit to adjust 
                    the water discharge based on what different type of floor it’s cleaning to prevent
                    it from being oversoaked. For extra convenience, the drawer dust box and water 
                    tank are designed for quick and easy removal, which makes them very easy to clean.
                    The built-in sensors provide flexibility to handle complex home environments and 
                    ensure worry-free cleaning. Its zigzag and y-shaped cleaning path is optimized 
                    for a measured cleaning process and improved cleaning efficiency. You can also 
                    easily connect to the Mi Home/Xiaomi Home app for easy operation when you’re out 
                    and to set scheduled cleaning tasks.</p>
