                <p>Enjoy delicious low-fat food by using less oil and a smoke-free 
                    cooking experience with the Xiaomi Mi Smart Air Fryer. The oil 
                    inside the food is thoroughly fried through the 360° heated 
                    air circulation, providing delicious food with less grease and 
                    fat. High-speed circulation of the heat current ensures that
                    the food is heated evenly, creating a crispy outer layer while
                    keeping the inside soft. The temperature can also be adjusted 
                    between 40℃ to 200℃. The modern-looking minimalistic design 
                    will fit right into your kitchen and add some style. The sleek 
                    OLED touch-screen makes knobs and buttons a thing of the past 
                    and simplifies cleaning.<br><br>

                    With the configuration of the dual-speed fan, the air fryer 
                    can do more than just fry your food. It can also defrost your 
                    frozen goods, dry fruits, and ferment vegetables. The 1500W 
                    heating power enables rapid temperature increase and more 
                    balanced heat distribution inside the fryer, shortening the 
                    cooking time, offering a faster, healthier, and more convenient
                    lifestyle.<br><br>

                    Low temperatures are automatically paired with the low 
                    rotating speed of the dual-speed motor for a slow temperature 
                    increase. The medium to the high-temperature range is 
                    automatically paired with a high rotating speed of the 
                    dual-speed motor for rapid temperature increase. It can do 
                    all of this over a cooking time of up to 24 hours, giving you 
                    more options and versatility in the kitchen. Longer continuous
                    heating in conjunction with a broader temperate range offers 
                    more cooking possibilities. Make snacks like dried fruit, 
                    dried meat, and yoghurt for the entire family.<br><br>

                    The over 100 smart recipes make it easy for beginners to 
                    cook delicious food. The fryer also supports custom cooking 
                    modes, so that home cooks can adjust the settings as they 
                    please. Ask the voice assistant to turn the fryer on/off and 
                    enjoy a smarter way of cooking. Scheduled cooking gives you 
                    even more options during the day. Get your cooking done even 
                    if you’re busy. Simply put your food in the fryer in advance, 
                    and enjoy the hot delicious meal waiting for you when you come
                    back from work at night.</p>
